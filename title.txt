# **Part 1: Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

## **1.1 What is NLP?**
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human languages. It enables machines to understand, interpret, generate, and respond to text or speech in a meaningful way. NLP is crucial for automating tasks such as language translation, sentiment analysis, and text summarization. It combines linguistics, statistics, and machine learning to analyze text-based data efficiently.

## **1.2 Key Components of NLP**
1. **Tokenization** – Breaking text into words or sentences for easier analysis.
2. **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging** – Assigning grammatical categories to words in a sentence.
3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** – Extracting proper nouns such as names, locations, and organizations.
4. **Lemmatization and Stemming** – Converting words to their base or root form.
5. **Dependency Parsing** – Analyzing sentence structure and grammatical relationships.
6. **Word Embeddings** – Representing words as numerical vectors for deep learning models.
7. **Topic Modeling** – Identifying key themes and topics in large textual data.
8. **Coreference Resolution** – Determining which words refer to the same entity in a text.

## **1.3 NLP Techniques and Algorithms**
- **Rule-Based Methods** – Using predefined linguistic rules for text processing.
- **Statistical NLP** – Applying probability-based approaches to language modeling.
- **Machine Learning-Based NLP** – Training algorithms to recognize language patterns.

## **1.5 Challenges in NLP**
- **Ambiguity and Context Understanding** – Words and sentences may have multiple meanings.
- **Language Variability and Evolution** – New words and phrases emerge regularly.
- **Lack of High-Quality Training Data** – Many languages lack annotated datasets.
- **Bias in NLP Models** – Training data may introduce unwanted biases.
- **Multilingual NLP and Low-Resource Languages** – Many languages lack sufficient research and development.
